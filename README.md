# Blog App

Simple blog application written in PHP with a connection to MySQL database. 

Users can set up profiles, add posts and comments, like other user's posts and see other user's profiles. 

All posts and comments can be edited or deleted by the post/comment author. Users can also delete their profile altogether which will erase any activity made by them. 

Forgotten password reset can be requested via email that was registered in the system. This function was created with the use of PHPMailer. 

Gmail account information and Database passwords are replaced with placeholders (db.php file on lines 14-17 and 194-195).

The deployed version could be seen here:
