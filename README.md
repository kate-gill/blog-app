# Blog App

This is a simple blog application written in PHP with a MySQL database connection.

Users can set up profiles, create posts and comments, like other user's posts, and view other user's profiles. All posts and comments can be edited or deleted by the post/comment author. Users can also delete their profile, which will erase any activity made by them.

The application features a password reset function that can be requested via email. This function has been developed using PHPMailer.

To protect sensitive information, Gmail account credentials and database passwords are replaced with placeholders (in the db.php file on lines 14-17 and 194-195).
